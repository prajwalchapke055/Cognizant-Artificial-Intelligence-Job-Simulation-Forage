# ------- BEFORE STARTING - SOME BASIC TIPS
# You can add a comment within a Python file by using a hashtag '#'
# Anything that comes after the hashtag on the same line, will be considered
# a comment and won't be executed as code by the Python interpreter.

# --- 1) IMPORTING PACKAGES
# The first thing you should always do in a Python file is to import any
# packages that you will need within the file. This should always go at the top
# of the file

# --- 2) DEFINE GLOBAL CONSTANTS
# Constants are variables that should remain the same througout the entire running
# of the module. You should define these after the imports at the top of the file.
# You should give global constants a name and ensure that they are in all upper
# case, such as: UPPER_CASE

# --- 3) ALGORITHM CODE
# Next, we should write our code that will be executed when a model needs to be 
# trained. There are many ways to structure this code and it is your choice 
# how you wish to do this. The code in the 'module_helper.py' file will break
# the code down into independent functions, which is 1 option. 
# Include your algorithm code in this section below:
 
# --- 4) MAIN FUNCTION
# Your algorithm code should contain modular code that can be run independently.
# You may want to include a final function that ties everything together, to allow
# the entire pipeline of loading the data and training the algorithm to be run all
# at once
